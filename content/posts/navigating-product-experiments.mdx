Challenges and opportunities of a remote team, and how we can make sure we communicate enough without overdoing it.

Remote product management strategies are no longer a “niche” topic. The importance of working effectively from afar has become paramount for many organizations. According to our [2021 State of Product Management Report](https://www.productplan.com/state-of-product-management-report-2021/), the desirability and willingness to work remotely and the growth of remote companies in the United States has grown by 2.8x. Of the 2,200 product managers that we surveyed, 67% chose to work remotely—across all company sizes.

But the challenge of filling such a cross-functional role remotely is particularly tricky.

So much of product management is about the relationships we form with our coworkers and customers, as well as effectively communicating complex subjects and building consensus. When impromptu in-person interactions aren’t an option, product managers must find alternative methods for building that rapport.

How can a product manager in a fully remote environment set the team up for success? Here are six ways to close the virtual gap.

### 1\. Replacing in-person interactions

Just because everyone isn’t in the same office doesn’t mean you can’t recreate some of the same dynamics. It only takes a little intentionality and a can-do attitude.

#### Virtual standups

Routines must be reinvented in a remote world, and one of the easiest and most valuable ones is the daily standup. Remote life means everyone can set their own schedule to some degree. Still, a daily convening of teams both makes important information transparent and makes everyone feel like they’re part of an organization.

Virtual standups come in two flavors: actual meetings and asynchronous updates. For an actual meeting, having everyone hop on the same audio or video call at a set time each day really helps set a tone and unifies the team. Everyone gets a chance to provide an update, and leadership can emphasize priorities or answer burning questions for the group.

If time zones or other logistical factors prevent a “real-time” standup, use a Slack channel, wiki, or another platform. It creates a forum for everyone to post what they did, are doing, and any blockers they’re experiencing. While this won’t build camaraderie, it does get the information flowing and ensures you hear from everyone at least once per workday.

#### One-on-ones

Building a rapport with key stakeholders is a secret weapon for many product managers. Instead of trying to win folks over during large meetings or presentations, they build relationships over time, [earning their trust](https://www.productplan.com/learn/how-product-teams-build-trust/) and getting a better understanding of their personal concerns and motivations.

When you’re all working remotely, those interactions won’t happen by running into each other at the water cooler or popping into their office for a few minutes. You need to make them happen.

Try scheduling regular catch-up sessions with key power brokers in the company, as well as customer-facing staff. You don’t need a set agenda, just set aside fifteen or thirty minutes to see what’s on their mind, share a few interesting anecdotes, or ask for some clarity and guidance on a particular matter.

Maintaining healthy working relationships with a broad cross-section of the company takes some effort. But it will pay dividends by giving you a better view of what’s happening around the company.

#### Regular roadmap reviews

If there’s one single thing to keep a remote team aligned, it’s a well-made and maintained product roadmap. Reviewing the current product roadmap on a regular basis with as many coworkers as possible serves two key purposes.

First, it keeps the product vision front and center. Product roadmap reviews remind everyone who’s working on what, and what the team can expect in the near term.

#### Virtual meetings

Sometimes text chat isn’t sufficient, and it’s time to break out into a virtual meeting. Every solution in this category will feature audio (usually with a dial-in number for those that don’t want to rely on their computer’s microphone and speakers). Some offer screen sharing, which is fantastic for demos and collaboration, while others include videoconferencing.

Although reading body language over a video chat isn’t the same as doing it in person, it’s still a nice way to feel like everyone’s in the same “room” for a while. Zoom, GoToMeeting, and Join.me are some popular options for this type of communication. Make it a house rule that unless there are extenuating circumstances, everyone turns on their video for these interactions.

Takeaways
---------

Thriving as a [product manager](https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-job-description/) in a remote working environment is possible. But product teams must be more vigilant. Ensure everyone working on or with the product remains engaged and on the same page. There’s no such thing as over-communicating when you’re remote. Establish as many opportunities as possible to give people a chance to listen and be heard.

Product retrospectives and lunch and learns might feel optional in a traditional workplace, but don’t skip these forums in this scenario. And don’t think you’re immune from office politics just because there’s no office. Egos and power moves will happen even when everyone’s making their coffee at home.
